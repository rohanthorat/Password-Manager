# Password-Manager
Password-Manager app for your local computer in nodejs.
I have built a local password manager using nodejs.
Packages used are as follow:
       *Node-Persist - to store the accounts locally
       *Yargs - to take command line arguments as input from user
       *Crypto - to use AES to encrypt the accounts

It also has --help function and an option to create a new account with master password and retrieve the same account using the same master password.
